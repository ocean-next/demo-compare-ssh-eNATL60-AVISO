# Demonstration notebook of comparison between eNATL60 outputs and AVISO data 

This is a live session from which you can run the notebook demonstration.

Both AVISO and eNATL60 surface fields are available on the pangeo cloud, 
they are listed in the official catalog for ocean products : https://catalog.pangeo.io/browse/master/ocean/

Dask dashboard plots are available to the right.  These will activate when you
run the cells in your Jupyter notebooks that create a Dask `Client` (these are already written for you).

To get started, double click on the notebooks repository on the left, then on the `compute-and-plot-mean-std-ssh-eNATL60-BLBT02-vs-AVISO.ipynb`,
and start running through the Jupyter notebook cells.

## Where is this running?

This session is running on [binder.pangeo.io](http://binder.pangeo.io), a service designed by the Jupyter community, 
and operated by the Pangeo community. This Binder is running on Google Cloud Platform.
